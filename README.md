A set of mini-games launched from the console. These games are similar to what is usually called Brain Games.

## Greeting
Greets user

## Game: "Check for parity"
The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown a random number. And he needs to answer **Yes**, if the number is even, or **No** - if odd.
Any incorrect entry is considered an error, for example, ```n``` and is equivalent to an incorrect answer.
